        <hr>
        <p class="aboutme">
            I am Karl Christian Santiago, and I was born on July 5, 2008. I'm currently a Grade 12 student at Escuela de Sophia of Caloocan, Inc., where I'm pursuing the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strand. I reside in Queensville Subdivision, Bagumbong, Caloocan City. In my free time, I enjoy playing online games, exploring topics that pique my curiosity, and playing chess. With a strong passion for technology, I aim to earn a degree in Computer Science and launch a career in programming, leveraging my skills to develop creative and impactful solutions.
